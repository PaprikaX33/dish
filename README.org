DISH: Idiotic shell.


* Purpose

  - A shell designed to be naive and bare bones.
  - Could be used for testing language

* Assumptions

  A list of assumptions to simplify the design
  - Assumes the terminal width is 80 characters wide.

* POSIX

  Currently the main objective of this project is to have enough feature to be usable as a shell,
  and POSIX compliantness is not the highest priority.

* Feature Pack List

  The implemented features are grouped to multiple "PACKS" with a similar functionality implemented

** Pack A: Bare Bone Minimum
   1. REPL
   2. Program Invocation
   3. Basic flags:
      - Help
        - -h / --help
        - -?
      - version
        - -V / --version
      - Invalid flag
